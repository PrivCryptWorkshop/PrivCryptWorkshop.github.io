                                    In recent years privacy-preserving technologies are experiencing a renaissance with increased interest from researchers and practitioners. While the underlying cryptographic concepts have been studied for decades, only recently researchers and practitioners started to intensively look into deploying such technologies. This creates new requirements regarding the functionality, compatibility, the need for efficient solutions as well as future-proof (e.g., post-quantum) constructions. Consequently, this also fuels the research into new foundational topics.</p>
									<p>The importance of the domain of privacy-enhancing cryptography can be witnessed by the numerous academic publications in the IACR community (CRYPTO, EUROCRYPT, ASIACRYPT, etc.), the Real World Crypto community (presence in RWC Symposia) as well as the numerous recent deployments in industry. However, all existing publication and discussion venues are much broader and there does not exist a dedicated workshop on this subfield so far. Our aim is to bridge this gap and introduce a new workshop that has a clear focus on these topics and can bring together interested people from academia and industry.
